before you run `make`, make sure to run `make programs` to build all the programs in the ./programs/ folder. (if you add your own programs). then run `make test` to, well, run the os

to choose a program, `make test PROGRAM="mothersday"`, replace mothersday with your program of choice (excluding the extension). choices of programs are in the ./programs/ folder
